## Learning Outcomes

This project showcases my ability to:

- Build reactive UI using **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3**
- Consume REST APIs using **Ktor Client** and display data in an MVI architecture
- Apply **Clean Architecture** for scalable app development
- Use **Hilt** for dependency injection across multiple feature modules
- Integrate **MPAndroidChart** for historical data visualization
- Implement advanced **search, navigation, and charting** patterns
- Work on **live data update integration** (WebSocket/polling) [In Progress]
